> Here's a simple [autoexec.cfg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AzimsTech/Dota2-AutoExec/main/cfg/autoexec.cfg) that I personally use. You're welcome to make use of it as well :)

The CFG is straightforward, contained within a single file, and is suitable for my needs. Additionally, you have the freedom to modify the configuration according to your preferences. üëç

## Usage

To use it, simply download the `autoexec.cfg` and place it in the following directory: `steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\cfg`.

To execute the configuration, open your in-game console and input the command `exec autoexec`.

(As an alternative, you can include `+exec autoexec` in your Dota 2 launch options to enable automatic execution of the configuration.)

‚ö†Ô∏è Keep in mind that launching the autoexec.cfg will replace your current configuration with the new one. If necessary, ensure you have a backup of your existing configuration.

## My Launch Options

1. `-novid` Skip intro screen.
2. `-noforcemaccel` `-useforcedmparms` Disable in-game mouse acceleration.

    ```
    -novid -noforcemaccel -useforcedmparms
    ```
